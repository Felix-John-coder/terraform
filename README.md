This project provisions a complete AWS environment using Terraform modules for VPC, EC2, IAM, and S3. It implements a production-grade architecture that securely attaches IAM roles to EC2 instances and enables controlled, least-privilege access to S3.

The deployment uses a remote backend with state locking to ensure safety, consistency, and collision-free collaboration across teams. Overall, the infrastructure follows modern best practices in cloud security, modularization, and operational reliability.
